### 6.3 Practice

1. Go to the RStudio Tips twitter account, https://twitter.com/rstudiotips and find one tip that looks interesting. Practice using it!

Ctrl + 1 (focus editor) and Ctrl + 2 (focus console) are my personal favourites.

2. What other common mistakes will RStudio diagnostics report? Read https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205753617-Code-Diagnostics to find out.

Common mistakes such as:

* Warn if variable used has no definition in scope  
* Warn if variable is defined but not used  
* Style

Also, diagnostics for other languages such as C++, JavaScript, and Python.
