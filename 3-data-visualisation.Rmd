### 3.2.4 Exercises

1. Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

Nothing. No layers have been added to `ggplot()`.

2. How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?

232 rows and 11 columns in total.

```{r}
mpg
```

3. What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.

`drv` describes whether the car is front-wheel drive, rear wheel drive, or 4wd.

4. Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cyl)) +
  geom_point()
```

5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = drv)) +
  geom_point()
```

Scatterplots are suitable for displaying continuous variables (e.g., `cty` and `hwy`). `class` and `drv` are discrete variables.
